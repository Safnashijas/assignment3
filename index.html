                                    Combe Hill is a causewayed enclosure, near
                                    Eastbourne in East Sussex, on the northern
                                    edge of the South Downs. It consists of an
                                    inner circuit of ditch and bank, incomplete
                                    where it meets a steep slope on its north
                                    side, and the remains of an outer circuit.
                                    Causewayed enclosures were built in England
                                    from shortly before 3700 BC until at least
                                    3500 BC; their purpose is not known. The
                                    enclosure has been excavated twice: in 1949,
                                    by Reginald Musson; and in 1962, by Veronica
                                    Seton-Williams, who used it as a training
                                    opportunity for volunteers. Charcoal
                                    fragments from Musson's dig were later dated
                                    to between 3500 and 3300 BC. Musson also
                                    found a large quantity of Ebbsfleet ware
                                    pottery in one of the ditches.
                                    Seton-Williams found three polished stone
                                    axes deposited in another ditch, perhaps not
                                    long after it had been dug. The site is only
                                    800 metres (870 yd) from Butts Brow, another
                                    Neolithic enclosure; both sites may have
                                    seen Neolithic activity at the same time.
